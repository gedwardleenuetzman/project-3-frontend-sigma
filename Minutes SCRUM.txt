Minutes from Previous Meeting
During the previous meeting we discussed the results of our final user studies, including the expert panel, and decided how to move forward with the final stages of the project in sprint 3. We assigned major task areas to each team member and decided what feature sets and feedback would be our main priority in the final sprint. Tasks were assigned and a couple of features were canceled or reworked.

Minutes from Previous Meeting
During the previous meeting we discussed what to do going forward about the final few features of the project, the crunch to get them completed on time, and how to assist each other in the final stages. The tasks assigned remained the same; we just had to continue working on them and get them done. A couple of new tasks were upcoming such as the documentation of the code but we wanted to fully implement all aspects of the MVP first.
